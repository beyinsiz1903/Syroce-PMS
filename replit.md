## Sprint 9 Changes (Calendar Assignment Clarity)

### Frontend
- **`frontend/src/pages/calendar/calendarHelpers.jsx`** — New urgency helpers:
  - `getUnassignedUrgency(booking)` — Returns `{ level, label, daysUntil }` where level is overdue/today/tomorrow/future
  - `getUrgencyBarColors(level)` — Tailwind color classes for urgency-colored booking bars
  - `sortByUrgency(bookings)` — Sorts bookings by urgency (overdue first → today → tomorrow → future)
- **`frontend/src/pages/calendar/CalendarGrid.jsx`** — Enhanced unassigned rows:
  - Urgency-colored booking bars (red=overdue, orange-pulse=today, amber=tomorrow, blue=future)
  - Left priority stripe on each bar
  - Countdown badge ("Gecikmiş!", "Bugün!", "Yarın", "2 gün")
  - Ring highlights for overdue/today bookings
  - Row background tinted by urgency level
- **`frontend/src/pages/calendar/CalendarHeader.jsx`** — Enhanced unassigned button:
  - Urgency breakdown text ("3 atanmamis (1 gecikmiş!)" or "(2 bugün)")
  - AlertTriangle icon when urgent bookings exist
  - Pulse animation when overdue bookings present
  - Color shifts: red border for overdue, orange for today
- **`frontend/src/pages/ReservationCalendar.jsx`** — Enhanced UnassignedPanel:
  - Summary cards: 4-column grid showing Gecikmiş/Bugün/Yarın/Gelecek counts with color coding
  - Filter tabs: Tümü/Gecikmiş/Bugün/Yarın/Gelecek (uses showUnassignedPanel state as filter key)
  - Bookings sorted by urgency within each filter
  - Left border color stripe per urgency level + urgency badge per card
  - Quick room assign: inline dropdown showing available rooms matching booking's room type

## Sprint 8 Changes (Automated Email Scheduler for Reports)

  - `GET /api/report-scheduler/report-types` — Available report types, frequencies, formats
  - `POST /api/report-scheduler/schedules` — Create new schedule
  - `GET /api/report-scheduler/schedules` — List all schedules (tenant-scoped)
  - `GET /api/report-scheduler/schedules/{id}` — Get schedule detail
  - `PUT /api/report-scheduler/schedules/{id}` — Update schedule

  - Manager+ role required for create/update/delete/toggle/send/retry
  - Staff+ role for read-only (list, history)
  - Uses existing `email_service.py` for SMTP/mock delivery
  - 11 report types: daily_summary, revenue, occupancy, reservations, guest_analytics, adr_revpar, channel_performance, b2b_analytics, housekeeping, financial, flash_report
  - Registered in `bootstrap/router_registry.py`

  - 4 KPI cards (total, active, sent, failed)
  - 2 tabs: Schedules list + Send History
  - Schedule cards with status badges, toggle, edit, delete, send-now actions

## Sprint 7 Changes (Navigation / Surface Consolidation)

### Channels Group (21 → 10 visible)
- **Hidden (7)**: `hr_rate_manager`, `rate_manager`, `hotelrunner`, `exely`, `data_model`, `integration_hub`, `admin_control_panel` — superseded by unified Channel Manager / Control Plane
- **Kept visible (5 admin)**: Channel Connections, Wire Failures, ARI Push, Lockdown Dashboard, Channel Ops
- **Kept visible (5 user-facing)**: Channel Manager, Unified Rate Manager, Room Mapping Wizard, Agency Manager, Early Warning

### Infrastructure Group (gained 3 items)
- **Moved from channels**: Control Plane, Runtime Cockpit, Incident Panel — these are platform-level ops, not channel-specific
- **moduleKey fix**: `platform_scaling` + `enterprise_live` changed from `"pms"` to `"advanced_analytics"` for consistency

### Operations Group
- **Hidden**: `pms_operations` (duplicate of PMS dashboard)

### Backward Compatibility
- All hidden items retain routes in `routeDefinitions.jsx` — direct URLs still work
- `hidden: true` flag filtered by `Layout.jsx` line 130: `if (item.hidden) return;`
