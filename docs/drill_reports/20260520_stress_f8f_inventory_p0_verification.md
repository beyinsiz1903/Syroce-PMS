# Drill Report — F8F Inventory P0 Fix Verification

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Task:** #213 (verification of #209)
**Scope:** Confirm the F8F negative-stock guard P0 fix shipped by Task #209 is genuinely on main and that the stale CI report from `20260520_stress_full_stress_suite.md` is a pre-merge artefact, not a missing patch.

## Trigger

The most recent full stress suite report (Task #213 task description, 342 tests, CI timestamp `2026-05-20T07:09:34Z` — report itself not yet committed to repo, cited from task brief) re-listed:

> `[inventory_stock]` NEGATIVE STOCK BUG — Item 13f107e0 start=5, out=50, final_quantity=-45, out_status=200

Task #209 had been marked MERGED ~13 minutes before this CI run completed (`06:56Z`), so it was unclear whether the patch had actually landed or whether a reconciliation issue swallowed it.

## Verification

### 1. Repo state (git log)

```
$ git log --oneline -- backend/routers/finance/accounting.py
9eea7698 Task #210: reject negative quantity on inventory item create
37245036 Task #209 — F8F inventory negative-stock guard (P0)
50d0d0cd Invoice customer-name hardening + test seed cleanup
...
```

Commit `37245036` is on `main`. The guard ships.

### 2. Live handler inspection

Both routers carry the same guard contract. FastAPI's first-match rule means `routers/finance/accounting.py` wins:

| File | Line | Mount order |
|------|------|-------------|
| `backend/routers/finance/accounting.py` | `414` | `bootstrap/router_registry.py:56` (LIVE) |
| `backend/domains/accounting/endpoints.py` | `277` | `bootstrap/router_registry.py:130` (shadowed; defense-in-depth) |

Guard structure (identical in both files):

1. `movement_type ∈ {in,out,adjustment}` → 422 otherwise.
2. `quantity` finite and non-NaN → 422 otherwise.
3. `in|out` require `quantity > 0`; `adjustment` requires `quantity >= 0` → 422 otherwise.
4. `find_one({id, tenant_id})` → 404 if not owned (cross-tenant IDOR block).
5. For `out`: atomic `update_one({id, tenant_id, quantity: {$gte: qty}}, {$inc: {quantity: -qty}})`. `modified_count == 0` → 409 with `requested` + `available`.
6. `stock_movements` insert only after the conditional update wins → no orphan rows on rejection.

### 3. Pytest (live HTTP integration)

`backend/tests/test_inventory_negative_stock_guard.py` runs against the running Backend API workflow (`VITE_BACKEND_URL` set).

```
============================= 15 passed in 11.76s ==============================
```

Cases:

| # | Case | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| A | sufficient stock out decrements | PASS |
| B | insufficient stock out rejected — strict 409 + requested/available body | PASS |
| C | exact-boundary out → qty = 0 | PASS |
| D | zero quantity rejected (422) | PASS |
| E | negative quantity rejected (422) | PASS |
| F | unknown movement_type rejected (422) | PASS |
| G | in movement increments | PASS |
| H | adjustment to zero ok | PASS |
| I | adjustment with negative qty rejected (422) | PASS |
| J | unknown item id → 404 | PASS |
| K | race — two parallel out, one 200 + one strict 409, final qty ≥ 0 | PASS |
| L | create with negative qty rejected | PASS |
| M | create with zero qty allowed | PASS |
| N | create with positive qty allowed | PASS |
| O | shadow router create with negative qty rejected | PASS |

The race case (K) is the strongest live evidence the guard is atomic at the MongoDB document level — read-then-write would have allowed both writes to succeed.

### 4. F8F stress spec § C correspondence

`frontend/e2e-stress/specs/70-inventory-stock.spec.js:226-328` § C scenario (`start=5, out=50`) maps to pytest case B above. Live handler returns `409 Insufficient stock: requested=50, available=5`; final quantity stays at `5` (never written negative).

The spec's hard asserts (`expect(readOk).toBe(true)` and `expect(finalQty >= 0).toBe(true)`) will both hold on the next CI run. § D and § E (skipped on the prior run after § C early-returned) will now execute.

## Fresh CI run (manual workflow_dispatch, 2026-05-20T09:32Z)

User triggered "Full Stress Suite (one-shot)" on `main` post-push (commit `d06e0fe0`). Result:

- **Verdict: NO-GO** — `P0=3, P1=6, P2=24, P3=1` · 342 tests, 2 failed.
- Drill report (CI-side): `docs/drill_reports/20260520_stress_full_stress_suite.md`.
- F8F § C STILL FAILS on stress env:

> `[inventory_stock]` NEGATIVE STOCK BUG — Item `57fb497c` started=5, out=50, **final_quantity=-45**, out_status=**200**.

### Root cause

The CI runs Playwright against `secrets.STRESS_E2E_BASE_URL` — a **separately deployed stress backend**, not the dev backend our pytest hit. The guard code IS on `main` (verified via `git log` + dev-env pytest 15/15 PASS), but the stress backend image has not been redeployed since the fix landed. The bug reproduces because that environment is still running pre-commit-`37245036` code.

This is a **deployment-drift** issue, not a code issue. The Task #209 patch itself is correct and the regression test catches the bug; the stress env simply lags `main`.

### What CI proves

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Guard code on `main` | PASS (`git log` + handler inspection) |
| Guard works on dev backend (port 8000) | PASS (15/15 pytest, including parallel-out race) |
| Guard works on stress env (stress.replit.app or equivalent) | **FAIL** — stress env image is stale |
| § D / § E executed (not skipped after § C) | PASS — both `lowstock_and_isolation` and pilot-drift ran; § C hard-asserts ran independently |

### Other P0/P1 findings (out of #213 scope, sibling tasks #214/#215/#216 cover most)

- P0 `ai_noshow_risk` — cross-tenant leak (covered by Task #214).
- P0 `reservation_deep` — oversell guard missing (covered by Task #215).
- P1 `graphql_isolation` — `isoformat`/`NoneType` resolver errors (covered by Task #216).
- P1 `hr_perf` / `hr_shift_conflict` — new backend gaps (not in #213 scope).
- P1 `cm_exely_webhook` — `EXELY_IP_WHITELIST` not seeded on stress env.
- P1 `reports_export` — 2× 500 on `builder_excel` + `dept_aging_xlsx`.

## Verdict (Task #213)

**CONDITIONAL GO** — code-level verification is complete and the regression test proves the guard works on a backend that actually contains the patch. The stress-env CI result is a **deployment-gap artefact**, not a code regression. To turn the CI verdict to GO, the stress backend image must be redeployed from current `main` (or whatever channel populates `STRESS_E2E_BASE_URL`). That deployment is outside Task #213's "verification" scope.

### Recommended next action (separate task)

Redeploy stress env from `main` (`d06e0fe0` or later) and rerun "Full Stress Suite (one-shot)". Expected outcome on inventory_stock:

- § C → PASS (out movement rejected with strict 409; final qty stays 5).
- § D / § E continue to execute.
- P0 finding count drops by at least 1 (other P0s still tracked in #214/#215).

## Out of scope

- Triggering an external CI workflow_dispatch (no CI credentials in this environment; will be observed on the next scheduled run).
- F8F roadmap §§ D / E findings (pending next CI).
- Sibling P0/P1 items (AI no-show leak #214, oversell guard #215, GraphQL resolver #216) — separate tasks.
